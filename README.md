# Polygons

Polygons is a tiny C program developped in my free time at 42 school for generating all polygons from 1 to 360 sides.

Some options are available:
* Zoom and unzoom
* Rotate the polygon
* Edit the shape of the polygon
* Edit the position of all odd and/or even vertex
* Choose from edge or fill for the display of the poly
* Navigate between polygons with 1 to 360 sides

## Install & launch
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Raiden-kazua/Polygons.git ~/Polygons
cd ~/Polygons && ./Polygons
```
You can also launch the program with a parameter. It's the number of sides you want for the polygon at the execution of the program. This parameter as to be between 1 and 360 included.<br />
Exemple :
```bash
./Polygons 10
```
